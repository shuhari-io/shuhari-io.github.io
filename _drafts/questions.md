##questions about the platform. things we need to work on

- Should we have different sub-sites for individual forums? like sub-reddits?
-- This might allow for people to organize more of a community feeling.
-- They could still be searchable from the main page.
-- People could be assigned as moderators... Much like reddit.
- How do we encourage feedback?
- How do we make money?
- How do we encourage an active community?  Credit system... gain credits for doing things like rating the lessons? Creating links between content.
