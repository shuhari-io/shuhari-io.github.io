I watched the movie Palo Alto last night, and it made me feel things.  This isn't going to be a critique of the movie, but more of an exploration of how it seemed beautiful.

Also, this will probably make sense if you've seen it.

While watching it, I found myself constantly referring to moments in my own life that shared similiarities with the characters.  The movie loosely follows a couple high school students around.  We see them party and puke, kiss coaches and boys, smile shyly at the hint of first love and cry alone in a bathroom amongst uncaring gossip. There isn't really a strong story, or a climax, we simply gain access to moments of life, decisions that at once seem fateful and inconsequential
