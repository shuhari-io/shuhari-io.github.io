##overview/executive summary

Shuhari allows people to curate existing online content into learning plans to suit their own educational needs. This seems like a bit of a mouthful, so what do we actually mean by that. 


##the problem space

While there is certainly an abundance of educational web content, there is a lack of structure linking these resources into a cohesive whole. Searching YouTube for fire spinning, knitting, or plumbing tutorials turns up an overwhelming amount of videos, but there is no clear way to know where to begin or how to progress through those videos. 

In summary, discovering how to learn something should be easy.  And it isn't.


##talk about how we see shuhari working.

Shuhari is a content agnostic platform for organizing content into an educational format. It is a repository for custom lessons created by users of the site that are called *curators*. These lessons can be on any subject that's educational with an eye towards [Performable and Portable](http://learncapital.com/education-vs-information/) knowledge.

###Creation
Shuhari's curators will be able to take a myriad of resources from around the web and place them into these step-by-step lessons (syllabus) to share with their peers. These *lessons* will be composed of individual *units* that can contain video, audio, or text. Each unit, should teach a discrete and measurable bit of knowledge. Each lesson will be tagged with appropriate keywords to make discovery easy, and each lesson will include links to pre-requisite lessons, sibling lessons, and follow up lessons. 

The linking between the lessons will allow any curator to fill in gaps in a body of knowledge with information that they feel is important.

###Consumption

Learning from Shuhari should be as simple and streamlined as possible.  Students will be able to browse all lessons, search for specific classes, and save lessons to a personalized learning plan. We will save a students progress in each lesson and remember what units they are working on or have completed. These bookmarks will allow students to track their progress and pick back up where they left off learning.


##Future goals

- Graph of information
- Self creating lessons from graph links
- Create communities around educational topics, allow for commenting and social recognition for contributions like StackOverflow


##questions about the platform. things we need to work on

- Should we have different sub-sites for individual forums? like sub-reddits?
-- This might allow for people to organize more of a community feeling.
-- They could still be searchable from the main page.
-- People could be assigned as moderators... Much like reddit.
- How do we encourage feedback?
- How do we make money?
- How do we encourage an active community?  Credit system... gain credits for doing things like rating the lessons? Creating links between content.
