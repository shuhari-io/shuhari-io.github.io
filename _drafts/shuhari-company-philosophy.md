> Delivering the web's best educational content.

Here at Shuhari, we want to deliver the web's best educational content to our users. Supporting this thought there are a couple core ideas that we believe about the state of online education. 

What we believe:

- Great educational content already exists on the web.
- That content is poorly organized across platforms.
- There are existing communities that would love a better way to teach.
- Communities want to reward their educators and experts. 
- We can enable a thriving learning ecosystem.


##Problem Space

We believe that the web has an abundance of quality educational content, but accessing that content can be difficult because the content is:

- Trapped in silo's created by the big tutorial companies (coursera, edx, howcast, udacity, udemy...).
- Completely isolated from any organized educational platform (individual blog posts, forums...).
- So poorly organized that it's virtually impossible to know where to begin and how to proceed from resource to resource (youtube, google search).


##How Shuhari Helps

> Shuhari will deliver the best educational content of the web to our users.

Here's how:

- Aggregate existing courses from popular providers
- Enable the easy addition of content into the Shuhari catalog
- Allow users to curate lesson plans of [Performable and Portable](http://learncapital.com/education-vs-information/) knowledge.
- Rank courses based upon required proficiency (beginner, intermediate, advanced/Shu, Ha, Ri)
- Create communities around educational subjects
- Track user progress through the educational content
- Shuhari will allow users to create pre-requisite and follow-up links between resources.


###Lesson Aggregation
We want Shuhari 

###Lesson Creation
Shuhari's curators will be able to take a myriad of resources from around the web and place them into these step-by-step lessons (syllabus) to share with their peers. These lessons will be composed of individual units that can contain video, audio, or text. Each unit, should teach a discrete and measurable bit of knowledge. Each lesson will be tagged with appropriate keywords to make discovery easy, and each lesson will include links to pre-requisite lessons, sibling lessons, and follow up lessons. 

The linking between the lessons will allow any curator to fill in gaps in a body of knowledge with information that they feel is important; like an educational wiki.

###Lesson Consumption

Learning from Shuhari should be as simple and streamlined as possible.  Students will be able to browse all lessons, search for specific classes, and save lessons to a personalized learning plan. We will save a students progress in each lesson and remember what units they are working on or have completed. These bookmarks will allow students to track their progress and pick back up where they left off learning.


##Future goals

- Graph of information
- Self creating lessons from graph links
- Create communities around educational topics, allow for commenting and social recognition for contributions like StackOverflow


##questions about the platform. things we need to work on

- Should we have different sub-sites for individual forums? like sub-reddits?
-- This might allow for people to organize more of a community feeling.
-- They could still be searchable from the main page.
-- People could be assigned as moderators... Much like reddit.
- How do we encourage feedback?
- How do we make money?
- How do we encourage an active community?  Credit system... gain credits for doing things like rating the lessons? Creating links between content.
