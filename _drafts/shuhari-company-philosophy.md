##overview/executive summary

Shuhari allows people to curate existing online content into learning plans to suit their own educational needs. This seems like a bit of a mouthful, so what do we actually mean by that. 


##the problem space

While there is certainly an abundance of educational web content, there is a lack of structure linking these resources into a cohesive whole. Searching YouTube for fire spinning, knitting, or plumbing tutorials turns up an overwhelming amount of videos, but there is no clear way to know where to begin or how to progress through those videos. 

In summary, discovering how to learn something should be easy.  And it isn't.


##talk about how we see shuhari working.

Shuhari is a content agnostic platform for organizing content into an educational format. It is a repository for custom lessons created by users of the site that are called *curators*. These lessons can be on any subject that's educational with an eye towards [Performable and Portable](http://learncapital.com/education-vs-information/) knowledge.

###Creation
Shuhari's curators will be able to take a myriad of resources from around the web and place them into these step-by-step lessons (syllabus) to share with their peers. These *lessons* will be composed of individual *units* that can contain video, audio, or text. Each unit, should be a bite size chunk of knowledge that can be easily 

###Consumption
As students progress through the units, we save their progress so that picking back up where they left off learning is simple. 


##potential solutions

##questions about the platform. things we need to work on

- Should we have different sub-sites for individual forums? like sub-reddits?
-- This might allow for people to organize more of a community feeling.
-- They could still be searchable from the main page.
-- People could be assigned as moderators... Much like reddit.
