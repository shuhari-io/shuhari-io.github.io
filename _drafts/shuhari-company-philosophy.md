##overview/executive summary

Shuhari allows people to curate existing online content into learning plans to suit their own educational needs. This seems like a bit of a mouthful, so what do we actually mean by that. 


##the problem space

While there is certainly an abundance of educational web content, there is a lack of structure linking these resources into a cohesive whole. Searching YouTube for fire spinning, knitting, or plumbing tutorials turns up an overwhelming amount of videos, but there is no clear way to know where to begin or how to progress through those videos. 

When approaching a topic as a beginner it should be clear where to start and how to progress. 

It should be easy for students of any discipline to begin learning and to continue studying. Shuhari will provide a syllabus-like framework allowing users to link together the educational content that already exists on the web.
