###Lesson Creation

Shuhari's curators will be able to take a myriad of resources from around the web and place them into these step-by-step lessons (syllabus) to share with their peers. These lessons will be composed of individual units that can contain video, audio, or text. Each unit should teach a discrete and measurable bit of knowledge. Each lesson will be tagged with appropriate keywords to make discovery easy, and each lesson will include links to pre-requisite lessons, sibling lessons, and follow up lessons. 

The linking between the lessons will allow any curator to fill in gaps in a body of knowledge with information that they feel is important; like an educational wiki.

###Lesson Consumption

Learning from Shuhari should be as simple and streamlined as possible.  Students will be able to browse all lessons, search for specific classes, and save lessons to a personalized learning plan. We will save a student's progress in each lesson and remember what units they are working on or have completed. These bookmarks will allow students to track their progress and pick back up where they left off learning. Students will also be able to share lessons with their peers and encourage a community of learning.
