> Delivering the web's best educational content.

Here at Shuhari, we want to deliver the web's best educational content to our users in a way that makes sense and makes it easy to start and continue learning. Supporting this thought, there are a couple core ideas that we believe about the state of online education. 

###What we believe:

- Great educational content already exists on the web.
- That content is poorly organized across platforms.
- There are existing communities that would love a better way to teach.
- Communities want to reward their educators and experts. 
- We can enable a thriving learning ecosystem.


##Problem Space

We believe that the web has an abundance of quality educational content, but accessing that content can be difficult because the content is:

- Completely isolated from any organized educational platform (individual blog posts, forums...).
- So poorly organized that it's virtually impossible to know where to begin and how to proceed from resource to resource (Youtube, Google search).
- Trapped in silo's created by the big tutorial companies (Coursera, Edx, Howcast, Udacity, Udemy...).

While there is certainly an abundance of educational web content, there is a lack of structure linking these resources into a cohesive whole. Searching YouTube for fire spinning, knitting, or plumbing tutorials turns up a large selection of videos, but there is no clear educational path through those videos. We will provide the links between that content.


##How Shuhari Helps

Shuhari will deliver the best educational content of the web by  engaging existing learning communities and providing an amazing educational platform.

Here's how:

- Allow users to link [Performable and Portable](http://learncapital.com/education-vs-information/) educational content together into step by step lesson plans.
- Rank courses based upon required proficiency (beginner, intermediate, advanced/Shu, Ha, Ri).
- Create communities around educational subjects through sharing and discussion.
- Track user progress through the educational content.


###Lesson Creation

Shuhari's curators will be able to take a myriad of resources from around the web and place them into these step-by-step lessons (syllabus) to share with their peers. These lessons will be composed of individual units that can contain video, audio, or text. Each unit, should teach a discrete and measurable bit of knowledge. Each lesson will be tagged with appropriate keywords to make discovery easy, and each lesson will include links to pre-requisite lessons, sibling lessons, and follow up lessons. 

The linking between the lessons will allow any curator to fill in gaps in a body of knowledge with information that they feel is important; like an educational wiki.

###Lesson Consumption

Learning from Shuhari should be as simple and streamlined as possible.  Students will be able to browse all lessons, search for specific classes, and save lessons to a personalized learning plan. We will save a students progress in each lesson and remember what units they are working on or have completed. These bookmarks will allow students to track their progress and pick back up where they left off learning. Students will also be able to share lessons with their peers and encourage a community of learning.
