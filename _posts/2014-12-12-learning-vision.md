> Delivering the web's best educational content.

Here at Shuhari, we want to deliver the web's best educational content to our users in a way that makes sense and makes it easy to start and continue learning. Supporting this thought, there are a couple core ideas that we believe about the state of online education. 

###What we believe:

- Great educational content already exists on the web.
- That content is poorly organized across platforms.
- There are existing communities that would love a better way to teach.
- Communities want to reward their educators and experts. 
- We can enable a thriving learning ecosystem.


##Problem Space

We believe that the web has an abundance of quality educational content, but accessing that content can be difficult because the content is:

- Completely isolated from any organized educational platform (individual blog posts, forums...).
- So poorly organized that it's virtually impossible to know where to begin and how to proceed from resource to resource (Youtube, Google search).
- Trapped in silos created by the big tutorial companies (Coursera, Edx, Howcast, Udacity, Udemy...).

While there is certainly an abundance of educational web content, there is a lack of structure linking these resources into a cohesive whole. Searching YouTube for fire spinning, knitting, or plumbing tutorials turns up a large selection of videos, but there is no clear educational path through those videos. We will provide the links between that content.


##How Shuhari Helps

Shuhari will deliver the best educational content of the web by engaging existing learning communities and providing an amazing educational platform.

Here's how:

- Allow users to link [Performable and Portable](http://learncapital.com/education-vs-information/) educational content together into step by step lesson plans.
- Rank courses based upon required proficiency (beginner, intermediate, advanced/[Shu, Ha, Ri]({% post_url 2014-11-11-shu-ha-ri %})).
- Create communities around educational subjects through sharing and discussion.
- Track user progress through the educational content.

We're very excited to move forward with this vision, and we hope you'll join us!
