title: Introducing Shuhari - A way to learn
---

Welcome to the [Shuhari](http://shuhari.io) blog.  I wanted to take a moment and introduce the concept of Shu-Ha-Ri, a learning philosophy, as I understand it. This concept has become foundational to how I think about learning, and has strongly influenced the development of Shuhari as a learning platform.

##Shu-Ha-Ri
[Shu-Ha-Ri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari) is a concept that stems from Aikido and describes the stages of learning a skill before achieving mastery. It can be loosely compared to the European apprentice-journeyman-master phases. 

###Shu
Shu, loosely translates to “maintain.” At this stage a student should be focused on imitation and following an existing path to a goal. Comprehension of the entire problem space or variety of options isn’t completely possible at this stage as it would only confuse the beginner who simply wants to accomplish a goal.

In my experience, this is the stage where I am solely focused on mastering basic skills almost exactly as they are presented to me. I find a variety of choice to be overwhelming as I don't have the understanding necessary to easily distinguish the pro's and con's of my options.

For example, if I was teaching a *Shu* stage student how to center clay on the pottery wheel, I would describe a very specific method to practice. I would only teach them one way, I would describe the concepts behind that method, but I would not show them a variety methods. I would want the student to be able to consistently reach the goal, a centered ball of clay, using only 1 technique.

When teaching and doing at this stage, a clear path to a goal is necessary. There is very little space in the student's mind for nuance and experimentation. The most important thing here is [imitation](http://jazzadvice.com/clark-terrys-3-steps-to-learning-improvisation/) to achieve a desired goal.

###Ha
Ha or “break” is when the student understands enough to begin learning alternate methods. Here the student understands enough about the way things are done to begin learning alternate methods. The student starts bending the rules learned in the Shu stage, and begins synthesizing these variations into a comprehensive whole.

This is where I'll have enough of a grasp on fundamentals to start examining the differences between methods I already know and new ways of doing things. This exploration of alternate paths to a potentially similiar goal, will help me discover and push the boundaries of whatever it is I'm doing (often with a healthy dose of failure).

When teaching a *Ha* student how to center clay, I would be more interested in the nuances of their specific throwing situation. This student is ready to learn and compare alternate methods centering. I would recognize that they can 

###Ri
Ri “transcend” is when the student has become a master of their craft and is no longer thinking about the right or wrong way to do things. They simply execute. They have combined all the techniques they have learned into a cohesive skill set that fits their individual style perfectly.

In the Ri stage (and I don't know if I've ever actually reached it), I have found glimpses of [flow](Link to ckisdjkfnosdf flow stuff) in the work that I'm doing. It's an amazing feeling to be able to strive towards goals with an intuitive understanding of your limitations and feel confident in the tools you have developed and in your decisions.


I discovered the concept of Shuhari while reading some of Martin Fowler's [posts](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html) about learning how to code. I have learned or taught myself a number of skills, and his description of Shuhari as learning framework rang true. It also helped me as a teacher.  It's important to understand what your students' level is and how to approach them at that level in a way that makes sense.
